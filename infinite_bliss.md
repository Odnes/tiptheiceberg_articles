Walked a few miles on flip-flops and my feet feel much better now... No drug can cure, drugs are merely there to help the body restore itself. And the body has hard requirements to give it's A game against disease. 

You can't expect to code well on 3 hours of sleep or when chronically sleep deprived or disturbed. Likewise, you can't expect any system of your body to preserve it's biological integrity effectively if you don't treat it like the antifragile machine that it is.

And you actually have to make this into a priority. The assumption of arguably your first deliberate social obligation, your job, stressed your body greatly. Now, this has got to stop. You've done nothing you'd recognise as valuable, assumed no noble responsibility, chased no bright star, and yet you've stressed and worn yourself down on pointless assumed obligations with no regard for the dear price you'll be paying for it.

And that, of course, won't be your health, because everyone eventually becomes dead anyway, and we are all constantly dying in creative ways no matter how we conduct ourselves and regardless of whether we're yet breathing while at it.

Health is vanity, like everything that men have managed to name.

You're paying in a stock that's infinitely scarce, and potentially infinitely valuable: your potential to realize and experience a future that means something to you. 

A future where that curious belief of yours may meet it's source
, that the infinite bliss of your childhood is realizable, in spite of how you're left fumbling in a dark forest far away from that place where you were born.

I came here today thinking to write something about text editors and such. Well maybe tomorrow.
