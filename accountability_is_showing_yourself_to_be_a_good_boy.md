Inspired by [100 days writing challenge](https://listed.to/@Listed/5202/100-day-writing-challenge)
Initially thought to aim for 30, but then I reasoned returns don't diminish in such a venture, and there's no extra shame if I fail 10 or 50 days early.

Thought of the day:
Accountability is showing yourself to be a Good Boy.

## In the court of the King of Fools
Self deceit is a monster beyond taming. Watching intellectually inferior people deceive themselves, and interacting with them in a way as to expose the deceit, explicitly or otherwise, my default explanation is that they deceive themselves out of need, not out of cluelessness or mere habit. 

Desperately clutching the thin, tattered mantle of exposed deceit, it is obvious they just want to be left alone, to live in a world where they can be "the king of fools".

I used to live in their shoes. I fashion myself as having overcome that stage, as having toiled to be more honest, aided by the sympathy and soothing acceptance of a new social circle.

There is, however, an alternative story as to what happened: I distanced myself from the people and situations before which my inadequacy was laid bare.

I've become smarter at lying, and more confident in the lies I can put forth. There's no one around who cares or is capable enough to challenge or suspect my narrative, therefore I get to feel safe in the lie I've holed myself in.

That's what the evolutionarily most advanced part of the brain [does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-brain_interpreter).

It's easy to be unaccountable to one's ideals in the day to day. I do get moments of clarity, whereupon my ideals stand to judge and condemn me. But, perhaps also as a consequence of those moments making me particularly miserable, they are scarce enough as to be of little use relative to the accountability another interested and intelligent human's judgement can provide.

## Crutches for crippled Egos
While that is definitely something to be pursued, perhaps by chasing a job or relationship that's "out of my league", the next best thing I know to work is [Beeminder](https://beeminder.com). Granted, it took me ~3 attempts to wrap my head around using it effectively, but eventually it did wonders for my productivity.

I refrained from using it when I got my first full-time job for $REASONS, foremost of which being that I could barely get by on my salary anyhow, so I couldn't realistically pledge money to be kept accountable.

But the classic refrain with Beeminder is the [crutch](https://blog.beeminder.com/crutch/), or perhaps training wheels argument. tldr; Internal discipline is !important(sic) and is antithetical to gimmicks and self-improvement apps.

## Journalling as a substitute for prayer
You heard it here first, folks! To pray is vital. It is what makes our internal resolve more than an equation involving glucose in the blood and neural structures related to inhibitory control. 
It is what translates our everyday interaction with the world into an intentional transformation of the above equation across time.
So that's what I'll be trying over the next one hundred days, in the form of waking up with the sole task of having my day's experience translated to something of value put down on hypertext document pixels.

Join me, and it'll be a merry trip.
