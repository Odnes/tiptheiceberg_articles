Interleaving work on tasks that entail fast, obvious progress, with dealing with tasks that are menial, unrewarding yet necessary, is a scheme that's worked great for me which I haven't heard discussed. 

I get easily bogged down and demoralized in dealing with minutiae whose resolution I deem necessary for my high standards to be met. Things just don't roll, one needs to have some fun doing whatever.
* As a cool guy said: *"Productivity is the joyous pursuit of execution."* Though "productivity" is one of those hip words for which I possess a visceral aversion.*

Changing this old habit of mine is key (one among a few I've yet to discover) to being able to toil sustainably.

That will be all for today, because being sick and suffering even as I write these lines, inspiration just doesn't flow. Writing brings no relief from that which ails me. Scratching figurative itches does nothing for the actual ones (oh man, this is torment!).
